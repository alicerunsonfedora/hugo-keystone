# Keystone Career Profile Template

## About this project
When I started working on my career profile for Consumer Economics, I wanted to create a static site with Hugo that allows me to post my content as needed.

This is a template that anyone can use to build their own projects.

## Getting started
### Pre-requisites

* A way of publishing your static site (I personally use Heroku with the Hugo buildpack)
* Hugo binary (if you plan to test your site locally)
* A capable text editor ([Atom](http://atom.io) is a good example)
* Basic terminal skills
* A GitHub account (for publishing source code and automating the process)


> Note: This tutorial will assume you are setting up your keystone project site with Heroku.


### Setting up Heroku
1. Register for a Heroku account if you haven't already.
2. Create a new app and name it whatever you like.
3. In the app's *Settings* tab, click 'Add buildpack' and copy the following line into the text box: `https://github.com/roperzh/heroku-buildpack-hugo.git`.

### Installing this Template
1. Register for a GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. On this template's source code page, hit the "Fork" button to fork the repository into your account.

### Editing your Settings
1. In the *Deploy* tab of your Heroku app, click "Connect to GitHub" under the Deployment method section.
